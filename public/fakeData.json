        "details":"OxyJet, is a low-cost non-invasive ventilator to designed to treat Covid-19 patients. The device can provide 60 L/min of oxygen with up to 100% concentration without any electricity. Interim data of ongoing clinical trials have shown that its efficacy is non-inferior to traditional high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) devices. However, OxyJet uses 30% less oxygen compared to HFNC devices for an equivalent clinical outcome. The device design has been open-sourced by the inventors.",

Most hospital wards in developing countries cannot provide more than 15 liters/min of oxygen. This is not sufficient for many severe Covid-19 patients who need a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or C-PAP ventilators. However, HFNC devices can cost up to $5000 and traditional C-PAP devices can cost up to $1000.",

It is easily manufacturable using 3D printing, CNC machining and combining available components in the market. Variants of the system can provide up to 100 L/m of flow if required. Non-vented C-PAP masks and HEPA filters are used in the system to reduce aerosolization.",

Besides, HFNO devices operate on electric power, which is unreliable in many low-resource hospitals - whereas OxyJet does not require electric power. With shortage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, this is a major problem since intermediate forms of treatments are simply not available at an affordable cost.",
